# Jobs to be done Canvas (Optional)

In this module, we will leverage the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Figma Canvas, an interactive, dynamic tool designed to guide us through the intricacies of developing AI-infused product experiences. The canvas provides a structured approach to uncovering customer needs, desires, and motivations, ensuring that our applications are always user-centered and purpose-driven. Using the JTBD methodology, we'll map out the critical job steps, pain points, and opportunities for innovation, translating these insights into actionable strategies as we make progress with the workshop.
