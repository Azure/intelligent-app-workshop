Inspired by Github Copilot's impact on developer productivity, this experiential workshop is designed to demonstrate how you can infuse similar intelligence and product experience into traditional software systems. Using [Microsoft's Copilot stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot) and practical [use cases](https://iappwksp.com/wksp/05-use-cases/#use-cases), this workshop will guide you in envisioning and creating intelligent systems and agents that integrate foundation models throughout your workflows and applications, resulting in improved productivity and hyper-personalized user experiences.

## Workshop Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, you will:

- Utilize Azure AI Studio for reasoning engines, Prompt Flow for LLMOps, AI Search for semantic retrieval systems, and Semantic Kernel for orchestration.
- Explore advanced capabilities such as AutoGen


## Topics for the Workshop

???+ info "Pre-requisite"

    Please sign up for [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://aka.ms/oai/access) and complete the [Getting Started with AOAI module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-openai/) to get the most out of this workshop.

1. **Brief Overview of Gen AI Capabilities and Use Cases**: Explore the art of the possible with multi-agent and advanced retrieval systems using samples like [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) and [Holmes](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/holmes). Engage in interactive demonstrations to envision potential applications with reasoning engines and semantic memory systems.
1. **AI Studio and Prompt Flow**: Quickly get started with your own copilot, grounded by your proprietary data in AI Search using our AI Studio experience. Customize it with Prompt Flow and deploy it to a production endpoint, including LLMOps integration.
1. **AI Orchestration SDKs**: Enhance your custom copilot by integrating it with existing APIs and incorporating advanced orchestration and multi-turn LLM interactions using SDKs like Semantic Kernel.
1. **Other Use Cases**: Explore AI Document Intelligence and Vision model capabilities for automating business workflows.
