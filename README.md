Welcome to this envisioning workshop designed to help you build your own custom Copilot using [Microsoft's Copilot stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot). This workshop aims to rethink user experience, architecture, and app development by leveraging reasoning engines (Foundation models and Language Models) and semantic memory systems.

## Workshop Overview

In this comprehensive workshop, you will:

- Utilize Azure AI Foundry for reasoning engines, Prompt Flow for LLMOps, AI Search for semantic retrieval systems, and Semantic Kernel for orchestration.
- Work with [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) codebase during the hands-on experiential workshop
- Explore advanced capabilities such as AutoGen and GraphRag

## Objectives

This workshop will guide you through the entire lifecycle of app development, including:

1. Identifying user needs
2. Developing a fully functional, production-grade app
3. Deploying your app on Azure with advanced capabilities

By the end of this workshop, you will have a deeper understanding of how to leverage Microsoft's tools and technologies to create intelligent applications.
